A <b><u>computer science</u></b> undergrad student, young entrepreneur and tech enthusiast. Who loves all things tech, from smartphones to self-driving cars. Selected by government of <b><u>NCT of Delhi</u></b> and <b><u>The Japan Science and Technology Agency</u></b> as a delegate to <b><u>Fukuoka</u></b>, <b><u>Japan</u></b> for Research & Development, accepted as a delegate by <b><u>Harvard Project for Asian & International Relations</u></b> (<b><u>HPAIR</u></b>) for <b><u>Harvard College</u></b> conference 2021 and featured in <b><u>Hindustan Times</u></b> and  <b><u>India Today</u></b> newspapers.<br> Intrigued by Outer space and passionate about building solutions for exploration.<br>
It’s important for people to have role models that look more like them in positions that they aspire to be in. I hope to show aspiring engineers that despite the current demographic in STEM fields, they should not be deterred in their ambitions.
I hope to show people that it is possible to take care of yourself, be happy and affluent in your endeavors — all within the current societal climate.
