> ### Why alternative App Store?

<br>
As most of us already know that Google suspends apps & elements and outdoors no legitimate reason. Even, if we think that the removal is an automated triggered by user reports or some other factors. The publishing authorities are unable to avail any explanation from Google Play. We have heretofore seen this pattern from Google in scads. However, there could be multiple reasons for this behavior, either it’s getting breathtaking for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps, which are decentralized to be on their store. Though it seems like a confederacy; But, I hope prior is true. Anyways, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern choices made by billions of smartphone users. A decentralized app store might be the best option against this sort of suspensions. And; The solution for this is GitHub App Store.

> ### Reasons to choose GitHub!  

<br>

- GitHub is an users platform, they listen to users queries and work on requirements.

- Source code of millions of tools, elements and applications is already hosted on it.

- Microsoft got their back; And, it’s been working great for and by the developers.

- Instead of posting comments, users will be able to raise their issues directly to the developers.

- Last; But not least, Users will get a Desktop friendly App Store.

It’s not a fight against other tech-giants. But, a suggestion to start a better service and I didn’t get any other better name than GitHub.
