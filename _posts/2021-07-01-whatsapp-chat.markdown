> ### Can WhatsApp turn any phone into a spyware?   

<br>
The answer is `YES`. Everything on your phone that is photos, emails, texts, etc.; could be accessed by attackers just because you had `WhatsApp` installed.

In `2018`, `WhatsApp` had to admit they had a very similar issue – a single video call via `WhatsApp` was all a hacker needed to get access to all of your phone’s data; And I've had experienced.

Every time `WhatsApp` has to fix a critical vulnerability in their app, a new one seems to take its place. All of their security issues are conveniently suitable for surveillance, look and work a lot like backdoors.

`WhatsApp` is not open source, so there’s no way for security researchers to easily check whether there are backdoors in its code and `WhatsApp` deliberately obfuscates their apps’ binaries to make sure no one is able to study them thoroughly. 

Security agencies use anti-terror efforts to justify planting backdoors. The problem is that such backdoors can also be used for chickenshit. Thus, autocrats astonishes `WhatsApp`.

At very early stage; `WhatsApp` was transferring messages in form of plaintext. Obviously a loopy act because not just "Black-Hats", But network service providers had access to all the `WhatsApp` texts.

On April 5, 2016; `WhatsApp` took action and implemented end to end encryption - "Third parties won't have access to messages". But `WhatsApp`'s imperative push for all of it's users to back up their chats in the cloud didn't dovetail with their end to end encryption because when backed up messages are no longer protected by end to end encryption and can be accessed by attackers.

`WhatsApp` users resilient enough not to fall for constant popup telling them to backup their chats can still be traced by a number of other tricks – from accessing their contacts’ backups to invisible encryption key changes.

There is an undeviating history of `WhatsApp`; from zero encryption at its inception to a succession of security issues strangely suitable for surveillance purposes. Reason being, Why? founders of `WhatsApp` left the company due to concerns over users’ privacy.

A lot of people can’t stop using `WhatsApp`, because their friends and family are still on it (including me). Most of the social media users are still pawned by the `Facebook`. And Let me tell you one more thing; that `Facebook` & `Instagram` stores your password in form of plain-text, even I don't do that on my own websites; Always prefer encrypting users passwords. But They think it's OK.

```I hope that the age of unctuousness will end!```
